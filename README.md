# React Note App

This is a simple assignment React project to learn React.

**Requirements:**

1. Create a new React application using Create React App or any other preferred method.
2. The application should consist of a single page with a header, a content section, and a footer.
3. The header should display the title of your application.
4. The content section should contain a button and a text area.
5. When the button is clicked, the text in the text area should be displayed below the button.
6. The footer should display some information about yourself or your favorite quote.

**Guidelines:**

1. Create a new React component called App to serve as the main component of your application.
2. Inside the App component, create three child components: Header, Content, and Footer.
3. The Header component should receive a prop for the title and display it as the heading of the page.
